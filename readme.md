# About

LESP Resources was created to solve a common problem faced by students: study materials like notes and resources are usually shared on WhatsApp, where they often get lost in endless scrolling or even disappear if the sender deletes them. To fix this, we built a cloud-based, organized system where students can easily access resources anytime without downloading them.

Currently, it is officially used by the Computer Department of Latthe Polytechnic, helping students stay on track with their academics in a more reliable and structured way.

- ⚡ **Lightweight & Fast** – Optimized to run smoothly on all types of devices.
